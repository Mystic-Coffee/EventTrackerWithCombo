# EventTracker with Combo 
 
## The Eventtracker with Sound for Gift Combos. 

<h1> What are Gift Combos? </h1>
<p> If a user drops two 50s in a row without anyone else dropping a 50 can the streamer set a specific sound in the music folder for up to 5 combos. </p>

<h1>Is there any problem?</h1>
<p>Yeah well, you cant set that the combos shouldnt be playing when you stream, they always play cus I'm lazy and working on another project.</p>


<h1>When do my normal ones get played?</h1>
<p>Every time they are not in a combo, therefore the first time they are seen.</p>
